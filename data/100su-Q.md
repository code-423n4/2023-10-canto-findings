# Check invalid weeks

In `LiquidityMiningPath.sol`,
- [L33](https://github.com/Canto-Network/CrocSwap-protocol/blob/2957ea046d52ff7187cc8d6809e5bb9b189196b8/contracts/callpaths/LiquidityMiningPath.sol#L33) and [L42](https://github.com/Canto-Network/CrocSwap-protocol/blob/2957ea046d52ff7187cc8d6809e5bb9b189196b8/contracts/callpaths/LiquidityMiningPath.sol#L42),  it is suggested that the following check 
```
require(weekFrom % WEEK == 0 && weekTo % WEEK == 0, "Invalid weeks");
```
 is updated to
```
require(weekFrom % WEEK == 0 && weekTo % WEEK == 0 && weekFrom <= weekTo, "Invalid weeks");
```
in order to let users know that those are invalid weeks.


# Avoid division-by-zero

In `LiquidityMining.sol`,
- [L175](https://github.com/Canto-Network/CrocSwap-protocol/blob/2957ea046d52ff7187cc8d6809e5bb9b189196b8/contracts/mixins/LiquidityMining.sol#L175), division-by-zero can happen when `overallInRangeLiquidity` is zero.
- The following check point can be added: `if (overallInRangeLiquidity == 0) continue;`
- Then, we can modify L169 to L173 as 

```solidity
uint256 overallInRangeLiquidity = timeWeightedWeeklyGlobalConcLiquidity_[poolIdx][week];
if (overallInRangeLiquidity == 0) {
    continue;
}
uint256 inRangeLiquidityOfPosition;
for (int24 j = lowerTick + 10; j <= upperTick - 10; ++j) {
    inRangeLiquidityOfPosition += timeWeightedWeeklyPositionInRangeConcLiquidity_[poolIdx][posKey][week][j];
}
```
- In the above, `overallInRangeLiquidity` can be checked first before calculation of `inRangeLiquidityOfPosition`.

In `main` branch, it seems to be resolved, but a line can be also fixed as above or the following.
```
uint256 overallInRangeLiquidity = timeWeightedWeeklyGlobalConcLiquidity_[poolIdx][week];
if (overallInRangeLiquidity > 0) {
    uint256 inRangeLiquidityOfPosition;
    for (int24 j = lowerTick + 10; j <= upperTick - 10; ++j) {
        inRangeLiquidityOfPosition += timeWeightedWeeklyPositionInRangeConcLiquidity_[poolIdx][posKey][week][j];
    }
    // Percentage of this weeks overall in range liquidity that was provided by the user times the overall weekly rewards
    rewardsToSend += inRangeLiquidityOfPosition * concRewardPerWeek_[poolIdx][week] / overallInRangeLiquidity;
    concLiquidityRewardsClaimed_[poolIdx][posKey][week] = true;
}
```
- In above, `concLiquidityRewardsClaimed_[poolIdx][posKey][week] = true;` is moved into if-loop in order to save gas.

# Check non-zero liquidity 

In `LiquidityMining.sol`,
- [L48](https://github.com/Canto-Network/CrocSwap-protocol/blob/2957ea046d52ff7187cc8d6809e5bb9b189196b8/contracts/mixins/LiquidityMining.sol#L48), if `liquidity == 0`, there is no meaning the codes below the line. So, the following revision is recommended to change from
```solidity
// Only set time on first call
if (lastAccrued != 0) {
    uint256 liquidity = curve.concLiq_;
```
to
```solidity
// Only set time on first call
uint256 liquidity = curve.concLiq_;
if (lastAccrued != 0 && liquidity != 0) {
```

- The same revision can be done in [L87](https://github.com/Canto-Network/CrocSwap-protocol/blob/2957ea046d52ff7187cc8d6809e5bb9b189196b8/contracts/mixins/LiquidityMining.sol#L87), [L191](https://github.com/Canto-Network/CrocSwap-protocol/blob/2957ea046d52ff7187cc8d6809e5bb9b189196b8/contracts/mixins/LiquidityMining.sol#L191), and [L221](https://github.com/Canto-Network/CrocSwap-protocol/blob/2957ea046d52ff7187cc8d6809e5bb9b189196b8/contracts/mixins/LiquidityMining.sol#L221).
