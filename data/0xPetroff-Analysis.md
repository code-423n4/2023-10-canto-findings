I didn't invest much time in reviewing the protocol, but I'm pleased to report that I only encountered one issue during my evaluation. Upon a brief inspection, the overall quality of the code appears to be quite good. Despite my limited examination, it's reassuring to see that the protocol seems to have been implemented with care and attention to detail. **The development team has done an admirable job**. While more in-depth inspection was needed, my initial impression is **positive**.
