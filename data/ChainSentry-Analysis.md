### Analysis of Codebase

The Ambient Finance liquidity mining contracts employ a dual-layer architecture, separating core logic (LiquidityMining.sol) and command execution (LiquidityMiningPath.sol). The codebase uniquely integrates tick-based tracking for liquidity providers. It adheres to existing patterns like the Factory pattern for contract instantiation and the Proxy pattern for upgradability.

## Architecture Feedback

Modularization: The codebase could benefit from further modularization, especially in the LiquidityMining.sol contract, where reward calculations and tick tracking are tightly coupled.

Gas Optimization: Nested loops and multiple state changes could be optimized to save gas.

Event Emission: Lack of events for crucial state changes hampers transparency and traceability.


## Centralization Risks

Admin Privileges: Functions protocolCmd and userCmd lack proper validation.

Immutable Parameters: Some contract parameters are immutable, reducing flexibility.

## Systemic Risks

External Oracle Dependency: Contracts rely on external oracles for price feeds.

Gas Price Fluctuation: High gas costs could deter participation.

Unauthorized Reward Rate Manipulation: Functions setConcRewards and setAmbRewards lack access control, allowing any external user to manipulate reward rates. This is a high-risk vulnerability.

## Other Recommendations

Tick Initialization: Implement checks to prevent overwriting existing tick data.

Reward Zero Check: Implement a check to exit functions if rewards are zero.

Audit Third-Party Libraries: Ensure all external libraries are audited.

Access Control: Add an onlyGovernance modifier to setConcRewards and setAmbRewards.

Timelock: Consider adding a time delay before reward rate changes take effect.

Transparency: Emit events on reward rate changes.
