## Project Description 
# Canto's New Liquidity Mining Feature

Canto is introducing a new liquidity mining feature tailored for **Ambient Finance**. This feature will be realized via a sidecar contract that interacts with Ambient through their proxy contract design.

## Key Components:

### 1. New Contracts:
   - **LiquidityMiningPath.sol**: Allows users to interface with the contract.
   - **LiquidityMining.sol**: Contains all necessary logic.

### 2. Purpose of LiquidityMining Sidecar:
   The sidecar is fashioned to implement a liquidity mining protocol for Ambient. Canto's objective is to utilize this sidecar to boost liquidity for Ambient pools hosted on Canto.

### 3. Incentive Mechanism:
   The LiquidityMining sidecar emphasizes a specific liquidity range determined by the current tick. To be eligible for incentives, users need to offer liquidity over a span of at least 21 ticks, encompassing the current tick and an extra 10 on both sides.

### 4. Liquidity Mining Rewards:
   - The sidecar diligently tracks time-weighted liquidity on a global and per-user scale for both ambient & concentrated positions. 
   - This system enables the protocol to ascertain a user's contribution and duly reward them.
   - As an illustration, if only a single provider furnishes liquidity for an entire week, they are entitled to the full reward of that week.

### 5. Implementation:
   The central codebase pivotal for claiming and accruing rewards is housed in `LiquidityMining.sol`. Setting the weekly reward rate for the sidecar is imperative, and the authority to determine the reward rate duration lies with governance.

In its entirety, this innovative feature assures that liquidity providers are duly compensated in alignment with their contributions.


**The key contracts of the protocol for this Audit are**:

- **LiquidityMiningPath**: 

The LiquidityMiningPath.sol contract appears to be a proxy sidecar contract associated with CANTO liquidity mining. It's designed to move code outside the main contract to avoid Ethereum's contract code size limit. The contract should never be called directly or externally and is intended to be invoked with DELEGATECALL to operate on the state within the primary contract. It includes components related to CANTO liquidity mining and references several imported libraries.

- **LiquidityMining.sol**: 

The LiquidityMining.sol contract centers on the functionalities of liquidity mining, particularly related to the claiming aspect. Operating as a mixin, it encompasses functions that delineate the intricacies of liquidity mining, such as initializing tick tracking and monitoring tick transitions. This contract incorporates various imported libraries and is an extension of the PositionRegistrar contract.

##  Approach 
During the analysis, we focused on thoroughly understanding the codebase and providing recommendations to improve its functionality.
