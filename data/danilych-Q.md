## Recommendations
  It is advisable to refactor the import statements within the `LiquidityMining.sol` file to adhere to the recommended format.

# [FM-02] Underscore Formatting for Numeric Variables
## Description
  In the contract code, the variable `WEEK` appears to be used to represent a duration in seconds. To enhance code readability and maintainability, numeric variables like `WEEK` are commonly formatted with underscores between digits, such as `604_800`. This formatting style makes large numeric values more human-readable and reduces the likelihood of errors.  
## Recommendations
  Consider reformatting the `WEEK` variable to use underscores between digits, adhering to the convention of `604_800` for improved readability. This formatting change promotes consistency and clarity within the codebase, helping developers easily identify and work with numeric values.
