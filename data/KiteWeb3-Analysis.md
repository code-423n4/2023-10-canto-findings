## 1. Analysis of Codebase 

This analysis report is based on the audit of two smart contracts: `LiquidityMiningPath.sol` and `LiquidityMining.sol`. These contracts are part of the CANTO liquidity mining system and contain components related to liquidity mining operations. The Github repo of the project is https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto.

- `LiquidityMiningPath.sol`: This contract serves as a proxy sidecar contract that is used to move code outside the main contract to avoid Ethereum's contract code size limit. It contains methods for protocol control and user commands related to setting reward rates and claiming liquidity mining rewards.

- `LiquidityMining.sol`: This contract is a mixin that contains the functions related to liquidity mining claiming. It includes methods for initializing tick tracking, tracking tick crossings, and claiming concentrated and ambient rewards.

## 2. Findings
Most of the findings/vulnerabilities were found by the bots. The list of the bot findings can be read here https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto/blob/main/bot-report.md.

### Additional Findings
- Division Before Multiplication Results in Wrong Week Calculation / Unexpected Behaviour [Medium Risk]: 
- Local Variable Never Initialized [Medium Risk]
- Dangerous usage of block.timestamp for comparison. [Low Risk]
- Delete commented code lines for clarity. [QA]

## 3. Architecture Improvements

### Initializing local variables
Always initialise local variables to a sensible default value to avoid potential issues.

### Functionalities check
Ensure all functions and contract interactions have appropriate test coverage.

### Math
- Implement checks to prevent loss of precision during divisions. Consider requiring a minimum amount for the numerator to ensure that it is always larger than the denominator

- Perform multiplication before division to maintain precision and avoid unexpected behaviour.

### Code readability
- Consider refactoring the contracts to reduce cyclomatic complexity. Cyclomatic complexity refers to the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. High cyclomatic complexity indicates that the contract might be hard to understand, maintain, and test. It is advisable to refactor the complex parts of the contract into smaller, more manageable functions. 

- Updating NatSpec comments of all functions adding all @param to improve code readability and understandability.

## 4. Time Spent
A total of 4 days were spent to cover this audit, broken down into the following:

1st Day: Reading and understanding protocol docs, creation of flow and policy management
2nd Day: Focus on linking docs logic to LiquidityMiningPath.sol and LiquidityMining.sol and preexisting contracts, coupled with typing reports for vulnerabilities found
3rd Day: Focus on different types of strategies contract coupled with typing reports for vulnerabilities found
4th Day: Sum up the audit by completing the QA report and the Analysis report

## Conclusion

The audited contracts `LiquidityMiningPath.sol` and `LiquidityMining.sol` are part of a larger system and cannot be fully understood in isolation. While the contracts are generally well-written, there are areas for improvement, particularly in terms of code complexity, NatSpec comments, and test coverage. Implementing the recommendations provided in this report should help enhance the quality and reliability of the code.
