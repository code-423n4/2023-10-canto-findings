# Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

- During this analysis, I focused on examining the Liquidation system of the Ambient protocol.

- Day 1: I spent time understanding the overall working of the Ambient system and getting an overview of the codebase, as well as possible centralization issues.

- Day 2: I conducted a detailed exploration of the Liquidation  mechanisms and possible systemic risks.  

- Day 3: I dedicated this day to preparing the final Analysis and  Architecture recommendations.


# Architecture recommendations

**Gas Optimizations**

- Review data types : Analyze the data types used in your smart contracts and consider if they can be further optimized. For example, changing uint256 to uint128 or uint94 can save gas and storage slots. 

- Struct packing : Look for opportunities to pack structs into fewer storage slots. By carefully selecting appropriate data types for struct members, you can reduce the overall storage usage.
 
- Use constant values : If certain values in your contracts are constant and do not change, declare them as constants rather than storing them as state variables. This can significantly save gas costs. 

- Avoid unnecessary storage : Examine your code and eliminate any unnecessary storage of variables or addresses that are not required for contract functionality. 

- Storage vs. memory usage : When working with arrays or structs, consider whether using storage instead of memory can save gas. Using storage allows direct access to the state variables and avoids unnecessary copying of data.
 
- Replacing the use of memory with calldata for read-only arguments in external functions .

**Other recommendations**

- Regular code reviews and adherence to best practices. 
- Conduct external audits by security experts. 
- Consider open sourcing the contract for community review. 
- Maintain comprehensive security documentation. 
- Establish a responsible disclosure policy for vulnerabilities. 
- Implement continuous monitoring for unusual activity. 
- Educate users about risks and best practices.

# Codebase quality analysis

**LiquidityMining.sol**

- The contract does not have explicit access control modifiers, such as onlyOwner or onlyAuthorized , to restrict access to sensitive functions. 

- 
- The contract lacks detailed inline comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the code.

**LiquidityMiningPath.sol**

- Contract is missing event and or timelock for critical parameter change. Events help non-contract tools to track changes, and timelocks prevent users from being surprised by changes.

- Contract’s public functions such as protocolCmd(), userCmd(), and acceptCrocProxyRole() not called by the contract should be declared external instead. 


# Centralization risks

- Ambient is a decentralized exchange protocol , that allows for two-sided AMMs combining concentrated and ambient constant-product liquidity on any arbitrary pair of blockchain assets. Non the less, there are potential centralization risks, To mitigate these risks, it would be beneficial to implement additional checks and balances in the permission management system.



# Mechanism review

- The mechanisms implemented by Ambient, including tunable parameters that can be dynamically adjusted by external policy oracles, are innovative and well-designed. They provide a comprehensive range of features and capabilities.


# Systemic risks


- Governance Mechanism Security: The contract’s governance mechanism is critical for its operation. A poorly implemented governance mechanism could lead to system-wide issues.


- Like any smart contract-based system, Ambient is exposed to potential coding bugs or vulnerabilities. Exploiting these issues could result in the loss of funds or manipulation of the protocol. 

- External Contract Dependencies: The main Ambient contract relies on 3 external contracts. If any of these contracts have vulnerabilities, it would affect this contract.

- Test Coverage: the test coverage provided by Ambient is the 75%, however I recommend 100% of the test coverage.
