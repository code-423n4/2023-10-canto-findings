[L-1] unnecessary exposure of setAmbRewards and setConcRewards in LiquidityMiningPath as a public function without access controller

While LiquidityMiningPath is a contract that the CrocSwapDex delegates `userCmd` or `protocolCmd` only, and all execution is meant to be done regarding storage on CrocSwapDex, the calling of setAmbRewards and setConcRewards on LiquidityMiningPath does not have access control as a public function that everyone can access. This let other to arbitrarily make change to the storage of relevant data like `ambRewardPerWeek_` and `concRewardPerWeek_` on the LiquidityMiningPath contract. While this does no harm the operation, this is unnecessary and create additional vulnerability if the logic is upgraded in future to include initialiser / or function that allow self-destruct or changes of the module with reference to its own data.
