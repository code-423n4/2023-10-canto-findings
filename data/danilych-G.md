# [FM-03] Redundant Division and Multiplication Operations
## Description
  In the contract code, there are instances of redundant mathematical operations involving division and multiplication. Specifically, on lines  `L51-52`, `L96-97`, `L208-209`, and `L238-239`, a division operation is followed immediately by a multiplication with the same value. These operations are redundant and not efficient in terms of gas consumption.  
## Recommendations
  It is recommended to refactor the code to eliminate the unnecessary division and multiplication operations. Instead, directly use the resulting value from the division where applicable to improve code efficiency.  
# [FM-04] Redundant Division and Multiplication Operations
## Description
  In the `claimAmbientRewards` function, there is a variable named `rewardsToSend` that is declared but not initialized. Later in the function, it is assigned the value of `rewardsForWeek` and used only once in the return statement. This usage of `rewardsToSend` is unnecessary and adds unnecessary complexity to the code.  
## Recommendations
  It is recommended to remove the variable `rewardsToSend` from the `claimAmbientRewards` function and directly use the `rewardsForWeek` variable in the return statement. This simplifies the code and makes it more efficient by eliminating the unnecessary variable assignment.  
# [FM-05] Custom Error Messages for Require Statements
## Description
  In the contract code, there are several `require` statements, specifically on lines `[176, 179, 194, 268, 271, 287]`, that use standard error messages. Custom error messages provide more context and clarity about why a `require` statement failed, making it easier for developers and users to understand the reason for the failure.  
## Recommendations
  It is recommended to replace the standard error messages in the `require` statements on lines `[176, 179, 194, 268, 271, 287]` with custom error messages that provide specific information about the condition being checked. Custom error messages should clearly convey the intent of the requirement.  
# [FM-06] Redundant Variable `time` in `accrueConcentratedGlobalTimeWeightedLiquidity` Function
## Description
  In the `accrueConcentratedGlobalTimeWeightedLiquidity` function, there is a variable named `time` that is initialized using the value of the local variable `lastAccrued`. However, the variable `lastAccrued` is not used in any subsequent calculations or operations within the function. As a result, the variable `time` is redundant and serves no purpose in the code.  
## Recommendations
  It is recommended to remove the redundant variable `time` from the `accrueConcentratedGlobalTimeWeightedLiquidity` function and directly use the value of `lastAccrued` where needed. This eliminates unnecessary variable creation and improves code readability.  
# [FM-07] Redundant Variable `time` in `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` Function
## Description
  In the `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` function, there is a variable named `time` that is initialized using the value of the local variable `lastAccrued`. However, the variable `lastAccrued` is not used in any subsequent calculations or operations within the function. As a result, the variable `time` is redundant and serves no purpose in the code.  
## Recommendations
  It is recommended to remove the redundant variable `time` from the `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` function and directly use the value of `lastAccrued` where needed. This eliminates unnecessary variable creation and improves code readability.  
# [FM-08] Use of Unchecked Block for Improved Gas Efficiency
## Description
  In the contract code, specifically on lines `L122-123`, there is a mathematical operation that increments a variable. This operation does not involve potential overflow or underflow risks, making it a suitable candidate for optimization to improve gas efficiency.  
## Recommendations
  It is advisable to place the mathematical operation on lines `L122-123` inside an unchecked block. The unchecked block can be used to explicitly indicate that overflow and underflow checks are not needed for this operation. This adjustment can result in improved gas efficiency for the contract.
