## LiquidityMiningPath.sol

#### Lack of input validation
The `acceptCrocProxyRole` function accepts two parameters, address and slot. It verifies the slot parameter however, it does not do so for the address parameter. Even though the function may be executed safely, the action performed in the function is crucial since a role is being assigned. Validating the address parameter should not omitted unless there is a specific reason to do so. To add on, the address has no name + no natspec to define it.

#### Missing Access Control.
The contract specification states that As such it should never be called directly or externally. However, almost all functions of the contract are public. This may not be a problem since other contracts might have to interact with these functions, but the functions in the contract do not have any checks in place to make sure that the contract is being called by the right person. There is a check to ensure that functions can only be called by governance but those checks seem to be commented out -> https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto/blob/40edbe0c9558b478c84336aaad9b9626e5d99f34/canto_ambient/contracts/callpaths/LiquidityMiningPath.sol#L66
