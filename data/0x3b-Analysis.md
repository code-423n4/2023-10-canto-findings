Basic analysis
In my attempt to understand the protocol, I found myself facing a time constraint that prevented me from delving as deeply as I would have liked. Instead, I resorted to a cursory examination of the protocol, looking at it from a high-level perspective. Regrettably, I could only allocate around an hour and a half to this review, which significantly limited the depth of my analysis.

Despite these time constraints, I diligently reviewed the protocol, aiming to extract as much valuable information as I could within the given timeframe. Unfortunately, due to the limited scope of my examination, I was able to identify only one **HIGH**.
