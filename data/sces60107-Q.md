# Summary

I list 2 low-critical finding2 and 1 non-critical finding:
* (Low) `LiquidityMining.crossTicks` should ensure `numElementsExit != 0`
* (Low) Changing the weekly rewards leads to unfairness.
* (Non) `LiquidityMiningPath.userCmd` is not compatible with `userCmdRouter` and `userCmdRelayer`

# (Low) `LiquidityMining.crossTicks` should ensure `numElementsExit != 0`
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto/blob/main/canto_ambient/contracts/mixins/LiquidityMining.sol#L30


## Impact

`LiquidityMining.crossTicks` updates `tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick][numElementsExit - 1].exitTimeStamp`. But it should check whether `numElementsExit ` is zero. Or `LiquidityMining.crossTicks` could revert.
 
## Proof of Concept

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto/blob/main/canto_ambient/contracts/mixins/LiquidityMining.sol#L30
```solidity
    function crossTicks(
        bytes32 poolIdx,
        int24 exitTick,
        int24 entryTick
    ) internal {
        uint256 numElementsExit = tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick].length;
        tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick][numElementsExit - 1]
            .exitTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
        StorageLayout.TickTracking memory tickTrackingData = StorageLayout
            .TickTracking(uint32(block.timestamp), 0);
        tickTracking_[poolIdx][entryTick].push(tickTrackingData);
    }
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

If `numElementsExit` is zero. no `exitTimeStamp` should be updated.
# (Low) Changing the weekly rewards leads to unfairness.

## Impact

Once the weekly rewards are set, the governor cannot change the value of weekly rewards. Because if one user has already claimed the rewards, changing weekly rewards leads to unfairness.

## Proof of Concept

The governor can set weekly rewards. And the functions donâ€™t stop them from changing the value of weekly rewards.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto/blob/main/canto_ambient/contracts/callpaths/LiquidityMiningPath.sol#L69
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto/blob/main/canto_ambient/contracts/callpaths/LiquidityMiningPath.sol#L78

However, if the rewards are changed. It only leads to unfairness. There are two examples.

Suppose Alice and Bob have the same amount of liquidity. The original reward is 1000. Alice claims the reward and gets 500.
1. If the governor updates the reward to 2000. Bob can get 1000, but Alice cannot claim the reward again. Alice only gets 500
2. If the governor updates the reward to 500. Bob can only get 250. Alice gets more reward than she should claim.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check in `setConcRewards` and `setAmbRewards` to stop changing the rewards.

## Impact

`userCmdRouter` and `userCmdRelayer` in `CrocSwapDex.sol` are used to call `userCmd` on behalf of another user. But `LiquidityMiningPath.claimConcentratedRewards` and `LiquidityMiningPath.claimAmbientRewards` always use `msg.sender`.

## Proof of Concept

`LiquidityMiningPath.claimConcentratedRewards` and `LiquidityMiningPath.claimAmbientRewards` always use `msg.sender`.

```solidity
    function claimConcentratedRewards(bytes32 poolIdx, int24 lowerTick, int24 upperTick, uint32[] memory weeksToClaim)
        public
        payable
    {
        claimConcentratedRewards(payable(msg.sender), poolIdx, lowerTick, upperTick, weeksToClaim);
    }

    function claimAmbientRewards(bytes32 poolIdx, uint32[] memory weeksToClaim) public payable {
        claimAmbientRewards(payable(msg.sender), poolIdx, weeksToClaim);
    }
```

But `userCmdRouter` and `userCmdRelayer` in `CrocSwapDex.sol` are used to call `userCmd` on behalf of another user.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

It seems to be a design choice, but the protocol provides `userCmdRouter` and `userCmdRelayer` in `CrocSwapDex`. It is better to be compatible with these two functions. Or the users may misuse these two functions.
